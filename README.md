SYNOPSIS

The printf function is a standard library function in the C programming language that is used to output a formatted string to the standard output. It is defined in the stdio.h header file and has a wide variety of formatting options to control the output.

The basic syntax of the printf function is as follows:
printf("format string", [arguments]);
The "format string" is a string that contains placeholders for the data that you want to print. The placeholders are denoted by a % symbol followed by a letter that represents the type of data being inserted (e.g. %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers, %s for strings, etc.). The [arguments] are the values that will be inserted into those placeholders.

printf function also support many additional formatting options such as field width, precision, and justification. It also supports conversion specifiers such as %d, %f, %c, %s, etc. With the help of these conversion specifiers we can print different data types.

printf is a powerful function and is widely used in C programming for debugging, displaying results, and formatting output.
